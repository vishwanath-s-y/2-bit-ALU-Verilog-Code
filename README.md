# 🔧 2-bit ALU Design using Verilog (EDA Playground)

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a 2-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL and verifies its functionality using a testbench on EDA Playground.

The ALU performs both arithmetic and logical operations based on a 4-bit control signal (op).

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 2-bit input operands (a, b)
- 4-bit output (alu) to handle multiplication results
- Enable signal (en)
- Multiple operations using case statement
- Fully simulated using testbench

---

## 🧮 Operations Supported

Opcode   Operation
0001     Addition (a + b)
0010     Subtraction (a - b)
0011     NOT (~a)
0100     Multiplication
0101     AND
0110     OR
0111     NAND
1000     XOR
